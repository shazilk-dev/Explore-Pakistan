# Explore Pakistan — Student Project

Simple beginner-level website for the Web Technologies course.

Features:

- Destination highlights (images + descriptions)
- Cultural insights and food recommendations
- Travel tips for visitors
- User gallery (upload photos and captions; stored in browser `localStorage`)
- Interactive map (Leaflet + OpenStreetMap) showing major spots

How to run:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (no server required).
2. The map uses CDN for Leaflet and will work with an internet connection.

Project files:

- `index.html` — main page
- `css/styles.css` — styles
- `js/script.js` — simple JS for gallery and map
- `assets/images/` — folder for any local images you want to add

Notes:

- This is a beginner-friendly project. The gallery stores images in `localStorage` as base64 (good for demo, not production).
- Replace image links in `index.html` with local images in `assets/images/` if you prefer offline use.
